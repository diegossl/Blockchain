# Blockchain

Blockchain technology is nothing more than a public ledger (or ledger) that records a virtual currency transaction (the most popular of which is Bitcoin), so that this record is reliable and immutable.

That is, the blockchain records information such as: the amount of bitcoin (or other currencies) transacted, who sent it, who received it, when this transaction was made and where in the book it is registered. This shows that transparency is one of the main attributes of the blockchain.
